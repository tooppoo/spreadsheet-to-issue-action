# Instructions for Fixing Issues Found in Code Reviews

When a code review identifies issues in your pull request, it's important to address them promptly and effectively. Here are some steps to help you fix the issues:

1. **Understand the Feedback**: Carefully read the comments and suggestions made by the reviewer. Make sure you understand the issues before making changes.

2. **Reproduce the Issue**: If the feedback points to a specific bug or problem, try to reproduce it in your local environment. This will help you understand the issue better and verify that you've fixed it.

3. **Make Incremental Changes**: Instead of making sweeping changes all at once, try to make small, incremental changes. This makes it easier to test and verify each change.

4. **Test Your Changes**: After making changes, thoroughly test your code to ensure that the issues have been resolved and that no new issues have been introduced.

5. **Update Documentation**: If your changes affect the project's documentation (e.g., README, comments, etc.), be sure to update it accordingly.

6. **Respond to Review Comments**: Once you've made the necessary changes, respond to the review comments to let the reviewer know that you've addressed their feedback. When reviewer is Gemini, you are allowed to resolve the thread.

7. **Request a Follow-Up Review**: After making your changes and responding to comments, request a follow-up review from the original reviewer or another team member. When reviewer is Gemini, you can request a re-review by commenting `/gemini review`.

By following these steps, you can effectively address issues found in code reviews and improve the quality of your pull request.
